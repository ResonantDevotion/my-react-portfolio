# Your Project Title
My REACT PORTFOLIO!

## Description 
This is was my last solo challenge with my skills bootcamp.
Here I had to build a portfolio using REACT.
I used bootstrap react, dynamically rendering items using props and also react router routes. 
This was a project that I was able to draw lots of different new skills together and also work on building an aesthetic which doesnt look half bad! Yay!
